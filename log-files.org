* ~/.emacs.d/elisp.log
Previous log files were project-specific.
Apart from them, there is also "global" log file =~/.emacs.d/elisp.log=.
Its content is created by my [[https://github.com/chalaev/elisp-goodies][logging code]] using =(clog ...)= commands.

=clog= outputs log messages both to ~*Messages*~ buffer and to =~/.emacs.d/elisp.log=.
When the variable  =*log-level*= is set to =:info= level
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar *log-level* 1)
#+END_SRC
in =~/.emacs=, only few log messages are output to =~/.emacs.d/elisp.log=.

To see more messages, set =*log-level*=  to =:debug= (zero) level:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setf *log-level* 0)
#+END_SRC
