I did not expect that this project would grow that big;
some of the desired functions are not implemented or half-implemented.

* Motivation
I like cloud file storages: they are cheap (or even free) and reliable.

However, some evil companies and governments are trying to spy on people using the information
that they extract from private data stored in the cloud.

Most of my important files (for example, emails or document scans) are not regularly changed;
for those I use [[https://github.com/gkiefer/backup2l][backup2l]] with gpg encryption, and store encrypted archives
using one of cloud services that allow ~WebDav~ access to the storage directory (Russian [[https://disk.yandex.com/][Yandex Disk]] or Swiss [[https://www.pcloud.com][pCloud]]).

This does not work so well for regularly changed files.
Since emacs is my only text editor, it is enough to write eLisp code that
1. Saves unencrypted file locally and simulteneously saves its encrypted copy on the cloud.
2. Every file opened in emacs can be added to the "clouded" list or removed from it.
3. Encrypted files are stored under randomly generated names and modification dates/times.
4. Remotely stored files are periodically syncronized with the local ones.
5. Dired-compatible: whatever I do with a file in dired (delete, rename), will be automatically done on other computers.

* Description
Synchronizing text files between different computers using
1. emacs,
2. some sort of a cloud that can be mounted to a directory, for example
   a. ssh- or an ftp-server, or
   b. some public cloud service like (Russian [[https://disk.yandex.com/][Yandex Disk]] or Swiss [[https://www.pcloud.com][pCloud]]) that can be mounted in linux
      using standard open-source utilities,
   and
3. symmetric encryption.

Intended for people who have =emacs= always open.

* Quick start
1. Mount remote directory. The mounting point is arbitrary, the default one is ~/mnt/cloud/~.
2. Evaluate ~cloud.el~; during the first run the code will generate gpg-password used for encryption.
3. Open dired: =C-x d=. Mark files you want to cloud (synchronize), and =M-x cloud-add=.
4. Every time we =M-x cloud-sync=, local files get synchronized with the cloud. For this purpose I have a line in my ~crontab~:
